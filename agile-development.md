Here is your **updated and reorganized document**, with **User Story moved to the top** and rewritten as the **core element of Agile + AI coding**.
I preserved your entire structure, improved clarity, and kept your diagram exactly as requested.

# 🌪️ **What Is Agile Development?**

Agile is a **way of building software step-by-step**, instead of doing everything all at once.

Traditional development = big plan → long time → big release → often wrong.
Agile = small plan → build small piece → test → adjust → repeat.

Agile focuses on:

* **Fast feedback**
* **Continuous improvement**
* **Delivering real value early**
* **Working software, not paperwork**

This is perfect for the **AI era**, where AI can rapidly generate code, tests, and prototypes — and Agile provides the best structure to guide AI with clear instructions.

---

# 🧱 **Key Concepts in Agile**

---

# 📌 **1. User Story 

A **User Story** is the fundamental building block of Agile development and the **best instruction format for AI coding**.

A User Story describes a feature **from the user’s viewpoint**, not from a technical angle.

Format:

> **As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit].**

Example:

> As a creator, I want to upload a video, so I can publish new content.

### ⭐ Why User Stories MUST come first (especially in AI-driven development):

* AI works best when instructions are **small, clear, and user-focused**.
* Each User Story becomes a perfect **AI prompt** to generate code, UI, tests, and documentation.
* Large features (Epics) confuse AI — user stories break them into **AI-manageable pieces**.
* Sprints are built **around User Stories**, not tasks.

In modern development:

> **User Story = the smallest unit of value + the core input for AI coding.**

# 📌 **2. Product Backlog**

The **master list** of all User Stories, features, bugs, and tasks.

It is the full inventory of everything the project may include.

The Product Backlog grows over time as new ideas and requirements appear.

---

# 📌 **3. Sprint**

A **short development cycle**, normally:

* **1 week**
* **2 weeks** (most common)
* **4 weeks**

A Sprint contains **multiple user stories**, selected during Sprint Planning.
The goal is to deliver completed, working features at the end of the sprint.

Sprint cycle:

1. Sprint Planning
2. Sprint Execution
3. Daily Standup
4. Sprint Review
5. Sprint Retrospective

---

# 📌 **4. Sprint Backlog**

A subset of the Product Backlog.

It contains:

* The **User Stories chosen for this Sprint**
* The **Tasks required to complete each story**

Your **product backlog** = everything
Your **sprint backlog** = only what you focus on this sprint

---

# 📌 **5. Epic**

A very large feature that must be broken down into smaller user stories.

Example Epic:
**“AI video generation system.”**

Break into stories:

* Upload image
* Generate base video
* Extend 5s video
* Add music
* Add subtitles
* Export video

---

# 📌 **6. Task**

A **small, actionable step** required to complete a User Story.

User Story → Tasks
Tasks → Done only inside a sprint

Example tasks for “User Login”:

* Create login API
* Design login UI
* Add validation
* Connect frontend and backend
* Write tests

---

# 📌 **7. Story Points**

A measurement of effort/complexity, not time.

Common values:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Story points help the team plan sprint capacity and track velocity.

---

# 📌 **8. Velocity**

The average number of story points finished per sprint.

Example:
20 → 22 → 21 → average ≈ **21 points per sprint**

Velocity helps predict delivery timelines and plan future sprints.

---

# 📌 **9. Daily Standup**

Short daily update:

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. Any blockers?

This keeps the sprint on track.

# 🧩 How Everything Fits Together (Keep This)

```
Product Backlog
 ├── User Story 1
 │     ├── Task A
 │     ├── Task B
 ├── User Story 2
 │     ├── Task A
 │     ├── Task B
 └── User Story 3
       ├── Task A
       ├── Task B

Sprint Planning → Select User Story 1 + 3 for Sprint

Sprint Backlog
 ├── User Story 1
 └── User Story 3

During Sprint → Complete all tasks for these stories
```

This diagram shows the **true workflow**:

* Work starts with **User Stories**
* Sprints select **User Stories**
* Tasks belong **inside** User Stories
* The Sprint’s goal is to complete **whole User Stories**, not random tasks
