# 🌪️ **What Is Agile Development?**

Agile is a **way of building software step-by-step**, instead of doing everything all at once.

Traditional development = big plan → long time → big release → often wrong.

Agile = small plan → build small piece → test → adjust → repeat.

Agile focuses on:

* **Fast feedback**
* **Continuous improvement**
* **Delivering real value early**
* **Working software, not paperwork**

This is perfect for AI-era development because everything changes quickly.

# 🧱 **Key Concepts in Agile**

---

## 📌 **1. Product Backlog**

The **master list** of everything that needs to be done for the project.

It contains:

* Features
* Bugs to fix
* Improvements
* Technical tasks

Think of it as your **big to-do list**, but not everything is urgent.

---

## 📌 **2. Sprint**

A **short, fixed-length development cycle**, usually:

* **1 week**
* **2 weeks** (most common)
* **or 4 weeks**

During a sprint, the team focuses only on the items they committed to complete.

Sprint cycle:

1. **Sprint Planning** — select what to work on
2. **Sprint Execution** — developers build
3. **Daily Standup** — short 15-min meeting
4. **Sprint Review** — show results
5. **Sprint Retrospective** — reflect on improvements

---

## 📌 **3. Sprint Backlog**

A subset of the product backlog.

This is the list of tasks/features chosen to complete during the current sprint.

Your **product backlog** = everything
Your **sprint backlog** = what you focus on this week/this sprint

---

## 📌 **4. User Story**

A simple description of a feature *from the user’s viewpoint*.

Format:

> **As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit].**

Example:

> As a creator, I want to upload a video, so I can publish new content.

User stories help teams stay focused on user value—not technical details.

---

## 📌 **5. Epic**

An **extra-large feature** that cannot be finished in one sprint.

Example:
**"AI video generation system"**
→ too big
→ break into smaller user stories:

* Upload image
* Generate base video clip
* Extend video
* Add subtitles
* Add background music
* Export final MP4

Each becomes a sprint item.

---

## 📌 **6. Task**

A **small, actionable piece of work** needed to complete a User Story.

Example User Story:

> As a user, I want to login so that I can access my dashboard.

Tasks:

* Create login API
* Build frontend login page
* Add email/password validation
* Connect frontend to backend
* Write unit tests

---

## 📌 **7. Story Points**

A way to estimate effort/complexity, not hours.

Common values:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Why story points?

* Measures **difficulty**, not time
* Avoids pressure of exact hour estimates
* Helps plan sprint capacity

---

## 📌 **8. Velocity**

The number of story points completed per sprint.

Example:

* Sprint 1: 20 points
* Sprint 2: 22 points
* Sprint 3: 21 points

Team velocity ≈ **21 points per sprint**

This helps predict how long the project will take.

---

## 📌 **9. Daily Standup**

A short daily meeting where each person answers 3 questions:

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. Any blockers?

It keeps everyone aligned.

---

# 🧩 How Everything Fits Together

Here is the flow:

1. **Product Backlog** — all ideas/features
2. **Sprint Planning** — choose what to build
3. **Sprint Backlog** — this sprint’s tasks
4. **During Sprint**

   * Work on **tasks**
   * Update **progress**
   * Daily standup
5. **Sprint Review** — show what’s done
6. **Sprint Retrospective** — improve process
7. Repeat with next sprint
